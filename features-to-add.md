✅ Finish dashboard setup

✅ Add map screen using library if possible that can display the satellite positions

✅ Change groundstations so that we can have worldwide monitoring

✅ Link with a real API to show live real world satellite positions in my dashboard

✅ Finalize README (env vars, run commands, sample requests, auth).

✅ Add 5–8 unit tests (API validation, repo queries, geocalc happy/edge).

✅ Capture one EXPLAIN plan showing an index helping.

✅ Add a basic rate limiter + API key check.

✅ Two diagrams: current mini-arch, future “ingest/queue/compute/read” with notes.

✅ Create rescue mission simulation that updates the simulated drone coordinates while it approaches the target coordinates

✅ Create load balancing system to simulate scaling the app 
(we can make copies of the different tables then )
